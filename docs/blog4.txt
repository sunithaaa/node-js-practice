Michael Lee Capel (born October 13, 1961) is a former Major 
League Baseball (MLB) right-handed pitcher who played for 
the Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers, and Houston Astros. 
In 49 career games, Capel pitched 62.1 innings, struck out 
43 batters, and had a career win–loss record of 3–4 with a 4.62
earned run average (ERA). While he played in MLB, Capel stood at 6 
feet 1 inch (185 cm) and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). A starting pitcher
in college and parts of his minor league baseball career, he converted to 
relief pitching while in Chicago's minor league system.

The Philadelphia Phillies chose Capel in the 24th round 
of the 1980 MLB draft, but Capel did not sign with the team: 
instead, he opted to attend the University of Texas. Capel played 
on the 1982 USA College All-Star Team, which competed in the Amateur
World Series in Seoul and placed third. The next year, Capel and the 
Texas Longhorns won the College World Series. After he was drafted by
the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play professional baseball; 
he played in six seasons of minor league baseball before he made his 
MLB debut in 1988. Capel spent the entire 1989 season in Triple-A, one
level below the majors, but the Cubs released him at the end of the 
year. He agreed to terms with the Brewers and played in MLB after an injury opened a s
pot on Milwaukee's roster, but was again released at the end of the season.
A free agent, the Astros signed Capel, and over the course of the season he 
pitched in 25 games for the team. He spent the final part of his career in 
the Astros farm system, and after he made the 1992 Triple-A All-Star team, 
Capel played his last season in 1993. After retirement, 
Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston, Texas.Michael Lee Capel (born October 13, 1961) is a former Major
